#### NumPy, Matplotlib – Practice Questions
01. Write a Python program that creates a NumPy array from a list of numbers and calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of the elements.
02. Find the number of occurrences of a sequence in a NumPy array.
    Eg: Arr = [[2,8,9,4],
              [9,4,9,4],
              [4,5,9,7],
              [2,9,4,3]]
    and the seq = [9,4] then output is 4.
03.	Find the k smallest values of a NumPy array.
04.	Calculate the sum of the diagonal elements of a NumPy array.
    Eg:Numpy matrix is:[[55 25 15]
                        [30 44 2]
                        [11 45 77]]
    Trace of given 3x3 matrix: 176
05.	Find indices of elements equal to zero in a NumPy array.
06.	Calculate the Euclidean distance using NumPy.
07.	Create two NumPy arrays of the same shape and perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on them.
08.	Calculate the determinant and inverse of a square matrix using NumPy functions.
09.	Generate Random Numbers from the Uniform Distribution using NumPy.
10.	Simulate rolling a fair six-sided die 1000 times and count the occurrences of each number.
11.	Write a program that uses Matplotlib to create a simple line plot of a set of data points.
12.	Create a scatter plot with labeled data points, adjusting the colors and markers.
13.	Save the Company Sales Data in csv file.

    a.	Find Total profit of all months and show it using a line plot.Generated line plot must include following Style properties: –
        ●	Line Style dotted and Line-color should be red
        ●	Show legend at the lower right location.
        ●	X label name = Month Number
        ●	Y label name = Sold units number
        ●	Add a circle marker.
        ●	Line marker color as read
        ●	Line width should be 3
    b.	Display the number of units sold per month for each product using multi- line plots. (i.e., Separate Plotline for each product ). 	
    c.	Calculate total sale data for last year for each product and show it using a Pie chart
14.	Load an image as a NumPy array and apply a grayscale filter to it.
15.	Load an image as a Mumpy array. Perform image manipulations such as cropping,resizing and color channel conversions. Visualize the original and modified images using Matplotlib.
16.	Plot a complex number in Python using Matplotlib ?
17.	Normal Distribution Plot using Numpy and Matplotlib
